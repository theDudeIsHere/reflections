What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	You tell git that this is not a normal directory but it is actually a 
repository that we want to track changes on.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	By using add file containing only one logical change to the staging area
and then commit those changes.  I can use git diff --staged to see that I am actually
doing only a logical change

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized?
How would branches help?
	Branches could help keeping history organized by creating fixed point in time or 
splits when testing new features.
