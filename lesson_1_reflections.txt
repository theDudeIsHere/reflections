How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    The viewing of diff between the two version help me narrow down my search
of the bug considerably

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Access to the entire history of a file would allow me to rollback any changes
I made that did not work properly

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, 
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

    Commiting mannually give you the freedom and the control to do it but automatically
would help you not forgetting to do it although it may not be needed

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files 
in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because Git is geared toward programmers.  Programs tend to involve a large number
of files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log gives me a list of commits ordered by time and get diff can be used to
analyze the difference between 2 commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break
something?
    I can make changes confidentally because even if I introduce a bug I can always go back
to a version before those changes were made.
